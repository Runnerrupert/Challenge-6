## Description

This is a Command-Line Project that allows you to build a vehicle with different specs and run different commands with them. This project is mean't to highlight what kinds of things you can do using classes from typescript to javascript. The most important thing that I gained from this while fixing the code and building different parts was how these classes are created and interact with one another. I hope you can learn just as I did!

## How to Install

This project requires you to run npm install to download all the dependencies, after doing that just run npm start in your terminal.

## Usage

There are a bunch of different inputs when it comes to building cars. There is one currently built for you. It will ask you whether you want to create or select a new vehicle. Create will have you choose a vehicle type and begin putting in the different specs for that vehicle. After it will assume you are using that vehicle. There are different commands to use after a vehicle is created and you can switch vehicles or exit the program.
